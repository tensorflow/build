# How to Contribute

To add your own project to our showcase, you can:

* Add a link and a short description to [README.md](README.md) in the same
  format as the other links, and then file a PR, or,
* Copy the [Directory Template](directory_template) into a new folder, fill in
  the template, and add it to the showcase. Make sure to update
  [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) as well.

This repo is a good place for small additions, but if the project is a big one,
it may be better to maintain it in your own repository for better encapsulation
of responsibility (and so you can make your own rules for further
contributions).

There are just a few small standard guidelines you need to follow as well:

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[TensorFlow's Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is mirrored in our
repository.
