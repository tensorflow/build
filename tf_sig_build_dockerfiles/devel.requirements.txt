# To have reproducible builds, these dependencies should be pinned always.
# Prefer pinning to the same version as in setup.py for now.
# This will change in the future.

# Note that we must use nightly here as these are used in nightly jobs
# For release jobs, we will pin these on the release branch
# Note that the CACHEBUSTER variable, set in the CI builds, will force these to
# be the latest version.
