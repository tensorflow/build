# Directory Template 

Example short description.

Maintainer: @angerson (TensorFlow, SIG Build)

* * *

This is is a sample of a new directory for showcasing a local project. Anything
goes, just please follow these rules to keep things straightforward:

- Name the directory the same as the title `in_snake_case` (all lowercase, with
  underscores, no hyphens).
- Your directory should have a README.md with a header:
    - Title identical to the one added on the root README.md
    - Short description identical to the one added on the root README.md
    - Maintainer: `<your email(s)> (<your organization(s)>)`. If you have no
      organization or not acting on behalf of one, write "Independent".
- You can add this directory to the root README.md list under any Showcase
  section. If it doesn't fit under any section, just put it at the top under
  "Showcase."
